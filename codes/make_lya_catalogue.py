"""
This is the script for making the Lya flux catalogue from the Lya skewers.
This will grab simulation results, normalize the fluxes, and split the transmission
into user-defined redshift bins. 
Output will be a fits file with RA, DEC, delta_F, flux redshift, flux redshift bin, QSO redshift, and weights.
